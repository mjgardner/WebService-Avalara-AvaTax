=head1 NAME

WebService::Avalara::AvaTax::Role::Dumper - Dump and restore compiled SOAP clients for AvaTax

=head1 VERSION

version 0.019

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Moo;
    with 'WebService::Avalara::AvaTax::Role::Dumper';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role handles the dumping of compiled SOAP client code to storage,
and then restoring it later to save time without having to recompile.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 use_wss

This role overrides the value of the
L<use_wss attribute from WebService::Avalara::AvaTax::Role::Connection|WebService::Avalara::AvaTax::Role::Connection/use_wss>
to false, since L<XML::Compile::WSS|XML::Compile::WSS> does not seem to
work cleanly with L<XML::Compile::Dumper|XML::Compile::Dumper>.

=head2 recompile

A boolean value you can set at construction to signal that the generated
class files for this service should be deleted and recompiled.
Defaults to false.

=head2 dump_dir

The directory in which to save and look for the generated class files.
Defaults to a temporary directory provided by
L<Path::Tiny::tempdir|Path::Tiny>.

=head2 dump_file_name

The path to the file in L</dump_dir> used to save/read the generated classes.
Defaults to F<< lib/I<package-name-converted-to-path.pm> >>.

=head2 clients

This role wraps around the builder for the C<clients> attribute to either read
in the generated class file (if it already exists) or generate it and then
add it to the symbol table.

=head1 CAVEATS

The generated class files in the L</dump_dir> directory will be read and
executed, therefore it is B<critical> that this directory is in a secure
location on the file system that cannot be written to by untrusted users
or processes!
