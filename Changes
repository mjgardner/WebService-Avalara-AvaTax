    - Empty results no longer result in dying with a Log::Report::Exception;

0.012     2015-03-16 22:11:13-04:00 America/New_York
    - default get_tax's DocDate to today's date in UTC

    - documentation fixes
0.011     2015-03-16 15:46:39-04:00 America/New_York
    - added "orthodox" attribute to get CamelCased SOAP operations as
      method names
0.010     2015-03-16 14:15:51-04:00 America/New_York
    - initial non-trial release
0.009     2015-03-13 14:53:17-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)
    - documentation fixes (Peter Sandin++)
    - use Mozilla::CA to verify HTTPS certificates (MIKEGRB++, Peter Sandin++)
    - Just return {parameters}{FooResult} hash reference as results, rather
      than the entire hashref from the call. You can always get full request
      and response details from the trace.
0.008     2015-03-12 17:46:27-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)
    - ::Role::Connection returns to provide factored out functionality to
    the new ::Service::Address and ::Service::Tax classes; the main AvaTax
    class now exists to simply bring the two services together, compile the
    operations, and wrap them in Perlish method calls
0.007     2015-03-11 15:32:31-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)
    - Added support for Avalara address service validation via validate()
      method. Since this service also has IsAuthorized and Ping operations,
      the appropriate methods have been renamed address_svc_is_authorized,
      address_svc_ping, tax_svc_is_authorized and tax_svc_ping.
0.006     2015-03-10 11:52:22-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)
    - remove extra "FooRequest => {}" around method parameters
0.005     2015-03-09 21:30:34-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)
    - rolled up WebService::Avalara::AvaTax::Role::Connection into main
      AvaTax class since it wasn't clear keeping it a separate role was
      offering anything beyond added complexity
    - made soap_service, soap_port and transport attributes private (i.e.,
      prefixed with a "_"), again to reduce complexity and API surface area
    - additional documentation
0.004     2015-03-09 18:11:51-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)
    - no functional changes
